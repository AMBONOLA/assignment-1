First Individual Assignment.

## Practice with GitHub 
For this part of the assignment, you will get practice with using GitHub in order to collaborate with other students in the class. We will be using this repository in order to collaborate together. First, we want to compile a list of hobbies for all of the students in the course. Then, we will dynamically order the compiled list of hobbies from least to most popular.

## You need to obtain a copy of this repository to your local computer so you can add your changes, then publish them back to the origin.
There are two common ways to do so. 
A: Clone the repository, create a new branch, make changes there, push the new branch back to the origin if you are an authorized collaborator, create a pull request and have your changes merged. 
B: Fork the repository to create your own repository off of origin. Clone your own copy, make changes, push them to your fork, then create a pull request to the original repository to have your changes merged. 
We will use option B. 

## Step One: Fork the repository
On GitHub, click on the button for forking this repository to create your own copy to your GitHub profile. Keep the name the samee.

## Step Two: Clone the repository to your local directory
